My configuration file for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].

[[http://ess.r-project.org][ESS]] is installed as described in the [[http://ess.r-project.org][instructions]], and not from MELPA!

So, this is:

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS.git ~/lisp/ess
#+end_src
